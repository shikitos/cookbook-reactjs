# Japanese Recipes and Design

This project features a collection of Japanese recipes and designs, with the majority of the content sourced from [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/). Users can add and edit recipes, which are stored in a MongoDB database using my own server-side API.

To run the application, both the server and client need to be started.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project and navigate to the "https://github.com/shikitos/cookbook-reactjs/tree/main/server" folder using your terminal.
2. Install all required npm packages using `npm install`.
3. To start the server, run the command `node server.js`. Use a separate terminal to keep the server running.
4. Next, navigate to "https://github.com/shikitos/cookbook-reactjs/tree/main/client" and install all required npm packages using `npm install`.
5. To start the frontend, run the command `npm start`. Use a separate terminal to keep the frontend running.
6. After the application has finished compiling, you can access it at `localhost` in your browser.
